/// PDO CONNECTION


4 VARIABLES

- name of database
- username and password to access database
- ip address of database (localhost means look for mysql on same computer)

DSN stands for Data Source Name, and it is a string that contains the necessary information for connecting to a database in a consistent format. In the case of PDO (PHP Data Objects), the DSN specifies the type of database, the server or host, and any additional connection options required.


///NOTES ON MYSQL

mysql.user is table of users in the mysql database
the host coloum is where the user can connect from



///NOTES ON SYNTAX


SELECT
	
	- retrives results from functions



Functions are meant to return a value and cannot modify database schema.
Stored Procedures can perform operations like CREATE TABLE or INSERT, and do not need to return a value.


If you are reloading a procedure that already exists, you may need to drop the existing procedure first using:
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS create_users_table;
