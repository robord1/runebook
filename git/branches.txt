Create and switch to a new branch (modern way)
    - One command (best habit):
        - git switch -c feature/coredata-cleanup

            This does two things:

            Creates branch

            Switches to it



Switch between existing branches
    - git switch main
    - git switch feature/coredata-cleanup




Merge branch back into main

    - Switch to main (merge target):

        - git switch main

    - Make sure main is clean:

        - git status

    - Merge:

        - git merge feature/coredata-cleanup



Push branches to GitHub 

    - git push -u origin feature/coredata-cleanup
